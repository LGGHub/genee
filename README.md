# Genee

Genee is a browser extension with utilities for genetic diagnostic professionals. This is an open-source project, and we're adding new helpful tools all the time. Feel free to contribute any ideas you have.

## What it does (so far)

Genee makes it easier to use public tools and websites. Here's what it does so far:

- Copy phenotypes from a Decipher Genomics case with one click
- Automatically copy relevant genes from a UCSC browser page
- Conduct Google Scholar, Google, and Pubmed searches with lists of genes and / or cytobands
